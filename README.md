Train a speech-to-speech model using your own language model. Currently based on the [Seamless Model](https://huggingface.co/collections/facebook/seamless-communication-6568d486ef451c6ba62c7724), but plan to support more models in the future.

This model is based on speech-to-speech models such as [Llama-Omni](https://github.com/ictnlp/LLaMA-Omni).
